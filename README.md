# How to start
I hope this will work :)
* git clone repository
* cd client
* npm install
* cd ../server
* npm install
* then just open 2 terminal windows and do npm start both in client & server
# Missing features
* Navbar after searching for the player isn't working to search for another. ( Didn't really start to work on it )
* Champion statistics -> because of a weak API key (can't make a lot of calls to LEAGUE API) I can't access all the played data for that season to be able to make a summary for you
* Many servers missing and some may not even work because in time of development I primarly focused on the EUNE/EUW to work but should be pretty easy fix
* More complex match data after onClick event show each players items etc...
# Known bugs
* Play time and time information in general not working before certain patch or because of games played more than a year ago ( didnt really go into it )
* Many more...
